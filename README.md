# concurrent-and-sequential-logic-vhdl

## Prompt

Write a VHDL program with both concurrent and sequential statements. For concurrent statements, please use CSA; for sequential statements, please use if statement. The goal is to achieve the following logic:

```
Function f(A, B, C) - 1 if ABC = 001 or 100; Otherwise, f = 0.
```
